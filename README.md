# Aircraft Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
This repository contains research work on predictive maintenance for aircraft systems using machine learning techniques. The project aims to predict potential failures before they occur, thereby reducing maintenance costs and improving safety.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset from Kaggle:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps)

This dataset consists of multiple multivariate time series with sensor readings from aircraft engines. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation, and develops a fault at some point during the series.

## Research Objectives
1. Develop accurate predictive models for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation
2. Identify key indicators of impending failure
3. Compare performance of various machine learning and deep learning approaches
4. Create a robust framework for real-time monitoring and prediction
